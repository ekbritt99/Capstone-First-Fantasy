# Testing
All the Unit and Behavioral Tests can be run from the Test Runner window in Unity. The test runner window can be accessed through the banner at the following location: 
Window > General > Test Runner

In the Test Runner window, there are two tabs where the tests are located (PlayMode and EditMode tab). In order to run all the tests for Play Mode or Edit Mode, select which mode you would like to test, and click "Run All". If the tests are successful, a green check mark will appear next to the individual test script name. If a test is unsuccessful, then an interdictory circle will appear next to the test name instead. An error section will appear at the bottom of the Test Runner window to give some information on what the error was. It may include details on any exceptions that were created or the difference between expected and actual values produced.

All the tests are located in the following Directories: 
- Assets/Tests/EditMode
- Assets/Tests/PlayMode
